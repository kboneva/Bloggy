# Project Description

Bloggy - a social media web site in which users can post their thoughts and share images, in short "blogs". The site is inspired by Twitter's design.
The client-side is a single page application built using ReactJS. The back-end uses Firebase for authentication, database, and storage. The project is deployed through Firebase Hosting.

# How it works

Guests are greeted by a welcome page, but can also take a look at a limited section of the catalog page, where they are asked to log in to see more.
Signed in users are able to interact with all posts, leave likes and comments, as well as make their own posts which they can edit and delete. When making a post, you have an option to upload an image as well. Any user's profile can be visited, and you can follow others. Every user has private access to a settings page, where they can change their own username, email, password, and avatar, as well as change their theme to light/dark mode.
In the catalog page you can choose to show posts from either everyone, or from those you follow. You can also find other users through a search bar.
